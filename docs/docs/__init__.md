# `meowdoc` Package

This is the root package file (`__init__.py`) for the `meowdoc` project.  Currently, it is empty.  It serves to indicate that the directory it resides in should be treated as a Python package.

**Purpose**

*   Marks the directory as a Python package, allowing modules within the directory to be imported using the package name.

**Related Files and Context**

The following files contribute to the functionality of the `meowdoc` package:

*   **`mkdocs.py`**:  Handles interactions with MkDocs, including creating MkDocs projects, updating the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file, and enabling themes. It takes the generated documentation and integrates it into the MkDocs site. Crucially, it updates the navigation structure to include the generated documentation.
*   **`core.py`**:  Contains the core logic for generating documentation using an LLM.  The `MeowdocCore` class reads input files, constructs prompts for the LLM, retrieves the LLM response (the documentation), and writes the generated documentation to Markdown files within the MkDocs `docs` directory.
*   **`themes.py`**: Defines available themes for the MkDocs documentation and provides functionality to enable them by installing the corresponding `pip` packages.
*   **`cli.py`**: Provides the command-line interface for `meowdoc`. It parses command-line arguments, loads configuration from a TOML file (`config.toml`), initializes the LLM provider, calls the core documentation generation functions, and updates the MkDocs configuration. It acts as the entry point for the `meowdoc` application.
*   **`llm.py`**: Defines the `LLMProvider` abstract base class and concrete implementations for different LLMs (Gemini, OpenAI, Ollama). It handles communication with the LLM APIs.
*   **`dummy_files/hw.rs`**: A dummy file (in Rust, despite the `.rs` extension not being handled correctly by meowdoc) used for testing and demonstration purposes.  It's important because the documentation generator needs to handle files of various types, even if it can't meaningfully generate documentation from them.

**Usage**

Because `__init__.py` is currently empty, it doesn't provide any directly callable functions.  Its primary purpose is to allow importing modules from the `meowdoc` package.  For example, you would use the following code:

```python
from meowdoc import core
from meowdoc import mkdocs
# ... other imports
```

**Future Considerations**

While currently empty, the `__init__.py` file could be expanded in the future to:

*   Define package-level constants or variables.
*   Implement package initialization logic.
*   Provide a simplified API for common tasks within the package. For example, it could expose a function that encapsulates the entire documentation generation process.

**Example (Hypothetical Future Extension)**

```python
# __init__.py (Hypothetical)
from meowdoc.core import MeowdocCore
from meowdoc.mkdocs import update_mkdocs_nav
from meowdoc.llm import get_llm_provider
import os

def generate_documentation(input_path, config_path="config.toml"):
    """
    Generates documentation for the given input path using the provided configuration.

    Args:
        input_path: Path to the file or directory to document.
        config_path: Path to the configuration file.
    """
    # Load config (example - you'd need to implement loading the config)
    # config = load_config(config_path)

    # Initialize LLM Provider (example)
    # llm_provider = get_llm_provider(config)

    # Initialize MeowdocCore (example)
    # generator = MeowdocCore(input_path, ... , llm_provider)

    # Generate documentation (example)
    # generated_files = generator.process_path()

    # Update MkDocs Nav (example)
    # is_input_dir = os.path.isdir(input_path)
    # update_mkdocs_nav(generated_files, is_input_dir, ...)

    pass # Replace with actual implementation.
```

This hypothetical example shows how the `__init__.py` could be used to create a more user-friendly API for the `meowdoc` package.
