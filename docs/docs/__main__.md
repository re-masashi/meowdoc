# `__main__.py` Documentation

This file serves as the main entry point for the Meowdoc application. Currently, it is empty.

## Module Description

The `__main__.py` file is typically executed when the Meowdoc package is run as a script.  Given its current state, it doesn't perform any specific actions. However, in a complete application, this file would likely contain the main function call to initiate the Meowdoc functionality, perhaps by importing and calling functions from the `cli.py` module.

## Interactions with Other Modules

As it is currently empty, this `__main__.py` file does not interact with any other modules.  However, based on the context of the other files, we can anticipate how it *would* interact:

*   **cli.py:**  The `main()` function from `cli.py` would likely be called from here.  This would kick off the entire documentation generation process by parsing arguments, loading the configuration, and calling the appropriate functions from `core.py`.

*   **core.py:** Indirectly, this file would utilize `core.py` through the `cli.py` module to generate the documentation.

## Example Usage (Hypothetical)

```python
from meowdoc import cli

if __name__ == "__main__":
    cli.main()
```

This hypothetical example shows how `__main__.py` would call the `main()` function from `cli.py` to start the Meowdoc application.  The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that the `cli.main()` function is only called when the script is executed directly (e.g., `python -m meowdoc`), and not when imported as a module.
