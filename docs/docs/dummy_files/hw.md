# Documentation for `dummy_files/hw.rs`

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the `hw.rs` file.

## Module-Level Description

The `hw.rs` file contains a single function named `hw` which prints "Hello World!" to the console. This is a simple "Hello, World!" program, often used as a basic introductory example in programming.  The file is written in Rust, indicated by the `.rs` extension, but it will be processed by the Python script `meowdoc` as if it were a Python file.

## Function: `hw`

```python
fn hw() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

### Description

The `hw` function is a simple function that prints the string "Hello World!" to the standard output.  It takes no arguments and returns no value.

### Parameters

This function has no parameters.

### Return Value

This function does not return any value (void).

### Example Usage

```python
fn main() {
    hw(); // Calls the hw function to print "Hello World!"
}
```

### Interaction with Other Modules

This function does not interact with any other modules. It is a self-contained unit.

## Potential Improvements

*   This could be expanded to take a parameter to allow the user to input the string which is printed.
*   Consider adding error handling (though not needed for a simple example).

## Note

This documentation was generated based on the content of the file and other files in the same folder.
