# Documentation for `dummy_files/hw.rs`

## Module-Level Description

This Rust file defines a simple function `hw` that prints "Hello World!" to the console. It serves as a basic example or a starting point for a Rust program. While it doesn't interact with other modules directly in its current form, it represents a fundamental building block that can be expanded upon and integrated into more complex applications.

## Function: `hw`

This function is responsible for printing the classic "Hello World!" message to the standard output.

```rust
fn hw() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

### Parameters

This function takes no parameters.

### Return Value

This function doesn't return any value (void).

### Example Usage

This function is straightforward to use.  It can be called directly from the `main` function or any other function in the program.

```rust
fn main() {
    hw(); // Calls the hw function to print "Hello World!"
}
```

## Interactions with Other Modules

Currently, `hw` does not interact with other modules. However, in a larger program, this function could be called from other modules to perform specific tasks, such as:

*   A module responsible for initializing the program could call `hw` to indicate successful startup.
*   A testing module could call `hw` to verify basic functionality.

## Further Development

This simple example can be expanded in numerous ways, such as:

*   Accepting user input and personalizing the greeting.
*   Integrating with other modules to display more complex information.
*   Implementing error handling and logging.

## No Docstrings

This code does not include any explicit docstrings. The function's purpose is simple enough to be understood from its name and code.  However, in larger projects, adding docstrings is essential for code maintainability and collaboration.
