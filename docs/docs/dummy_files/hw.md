# Documentation for `dummy_files/hw.rs`

## Module-Level Description

This Rust file defines a simple function `hw` that prints "Hello World!" to the console. It serves as a basic example to demonstrate the core concept of printing output in Rust.  This is analogous to a starting point often used in many languages.

## Function: `hw()`

This function prints the classic "Hello World!" message to the standard output.

### Parameters

This function does not take any parameters.

### Return Value

This function does not return any value (it's a void function).

### Example Usage

```rust
fn main() {
    hw(); // Calls the hw function to print "Hello World!"
}
```

## Interactions with Other Modules

This simple example does not directly interact with other modules.  However, in a larger Rust program, the output of `hw()` could be used by other functions or modules. For example:

```rust
fn hw() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}

fn greet_user(name: &str) {
    println!("{}, {}!", "Hello World", name);
}

fn main() {
    greet_user("Meowdoc");
}
```

In this example, `hw` is augmented to include `greet_user` which would take a name, in place of the normal `"Hello World!"`. This would show how different modules could relate.

## Additional Notes

This `hw()` function showcases a fundamental programming concept used across various languages. It's a starting point for learning about output and basic program execution.
