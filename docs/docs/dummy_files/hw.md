# Documentation for hw.rs

This file contains a simple Rust function that prints "Hello World!" to the console.

## Module-Level Description

The `hw.rs` file demonstrates a basic "Hello, World!" program in Rust. It includes a single function, `hw`, which, when executed, outputs the greeting to the standard output. This file serves as a minimal example for Rust beginners.

## Function: `hw()`

The `hw` function is responsible for printing "Hello World!" to the console.

```rust
fn hw() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

### Parameters

This function does not accept any parameters.

### Return Value

This function does not return any value.

### Usage Example

To use this function, you would typically compile and run the Rust program containing it.  This might be part of a larger Rust project.  If `hw` is in `src/main.rs`, then the program can be compiled and run using `cargo run`.

```rust
fn main() {
    hw(); // Call the hw function
}
```

This would output:

```
Hello World!
```

### Interaction with Other Modules

This simple example does not directly interact with other modules. However, in a larger Rust project, you could import and call this function from other modules. For example:

```rust
// In another module (e.g., src/greeter.rs)

mod hw; // Import the hw module

fn greet() {
    println!("A more elaborate greeting:");
    hw::hw(); // Call the hw function from the hw module
}

// In src/main.rs

mod greeter;

fn main() {
    greeter::greet();
}
```

In this example, `hw` is defined in its own module (`hw.rs`). `greeter.rs` imports the `hw` module and then calls the `hw` function from the `hw` module, allowing `greeter` to utilize the `hw` function's functionality. The main program then calls the `greet` function from `greeter.rs` to start the process.

## Notes

This example is very basic and doesn't demonstrate more complex Rust features like error handling, data structures, or traits.  It is purely for demonstration purposes.
