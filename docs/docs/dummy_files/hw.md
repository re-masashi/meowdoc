# Documentation for hw.rs

This file contains a simple function that prints "Hello World!" to the console. It serves as a basic example and can be used as a starting point for more complex Rust programs.

## `hw` Function

The `hw` function is a simple function that outputs "Hello World!" to the standard output.

### Function Signature

```rust
fn hw() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

### Functionality

This function uses the `println!` macro to print the string "Hello World!" to the console.  It has no input parameters and doesn't return any value.  It's a classic first program for learning a new language.

### Interaction with Other Modules

This file, in isolation, doesn't interact with other modules directly. However, within a larger Rust project, this function could be called from other modules. The functionality of printing to the console is a basic IO operation, implicitly interacting with the operating system's standard output stream.

### Example Usage

```rust
fn main() {
    hw(); // Call the hw function
}
```

This Rust code defines a `main` function (the entry point for Rust programs) that calls the `hw` function, resulting in "Hello World!" being printed to the console.

### Notes
*   This example leverages the `println!` macro from the Rust standard library.
*   To compile this code, you'll need a Rust toolchain installed. You can compile and run this with `rustc hw.rs` and then `./hw`.
