### Setting Up Your Development Environment

To get started with contributing code, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here's a basic guide:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Fork the Meowdoc repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/meowdoc.git
    cd meowdoc
    ```

3.  **Set Up Dependencies:**  (Replace with actual dependency management commands and instructions)
    *   Install necessary dependencies.  For example, if it's a Javascript project with npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    *   If there are any other environment variables needed, they should be configured here.

4.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/<your-feature-name>
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix/<your-bug-fix-name>
    ```

### Making Changes

1.  **Write Your Code:** Make your changes in the code, following the project's coding style and conventions.
2.  **Test Your Changes:** Thoroughly test your changes to ensure they work as expected and don't introduce any new issues.  Include unit tests, integration tests, and manual testing where appropriate. Run all tests before submitting.
3.  **Format Your Code:** Format your code according to the project's style. (Specify linter/formatter usage here if applicable - e.g., "Run `npm run format` to format your code with Prettier.")
4.  **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    git commit -m "fix: Fix bug in..."
    ```
5.  **Push Your Changes:** Push your branch to your forked repository:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/<your-feature-name>
    ```

### Submitting Pull Requests

1.  **Create a Pull Request:** Go to your forked repository on GitHub and create a new pull request from your branch to the `main` branch of the original Meowdoc repository.
2.  **Describe Your Changes:** In the pull request description, clearly describe the changes you've made, the problem you're solving, and any relevant context.  Reference any related issues.
3.  **Review Process:** Your pull request will be reviewed by the project maintainers. They may provide feedback and request changes.
4.  **Address Feedback:** Address any feedback provided by the reviewers.  Make the necessary changes, commit them to your branch, and push them to your forked repository. The pull request will automatically update.
5.  **Merge:** Once your pull request has been approved, it will be merged into the `main` branch.
