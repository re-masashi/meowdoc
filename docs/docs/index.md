### Setting up Your Development Environment

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Fork the Meowdoc repository on GitHub to your own account.
2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/meowdoc.git
    cd meowdoc
    ```
3.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):** Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies for this project. Using `venv` is a good option:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```
4.  **Install Dependencies:** Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Install Pre-commit Hooks:** We use pre-commit hooks to enforce code style. Install them with:

    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install
    ```
    These will run automatically before each commit.
6.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
    ```

### Submitting Pull Requests

1.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your changes, following the coding style and best practices of the project. Be sure to write clear and concise code. Add tests for any new functionality and ensure existing tests pass.
2.  **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages.  Follow the conventional commits specification (see below).
3.  **Run Tests:** Before submitting a pull request, make sure all tests pass:

    ```bash
    pytest  # Or the command to run tests in your specific project
    ```
4.  **Push Your Changes:** Push your branch to your forked repository:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
5.  **Create a Pull Request:** Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click the "Create Pull Request" button.
6.  **Describe Your Changes:** In the pull request description, provide a clear and concise explanation of your changes, including the problem you're solving or the feature you're adding. Include links to any relevant issues.
7.  **Code Review:** Your pull request will be reviewed by other contributors. Be prepared to address any feedback or suggestions.
8.  **Squash Commits (If Requested):**  You may be asked to squash your commits into a single, logical commit before merging.
9.  **Congratulations!** Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main branch.

### Coding Style

We adhere to the following coding style guidelines:

*   **Python:** We follow the PEP 8 style guide.  Use `flake8` and `black` to format your code.  Pre-commit should catch most style violations.
*   **[Other Languages/Frameworks Used]:** (Describe coding style for other relevant languages or frameworks)

### Conventional Commits

We use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for commit messages. This helps us automate releases and generate changelogs.

A commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Examples:

*   `feat(ui): add dark mode toggle`
*   `fix(auth): prevent unauthorized access`
*   `docs: update contributing guidelines`
*   `chore: update dependencies`
*   `test: add unit tests for parser`
*   `ci: configure github actions`
