## Contributing to meowdoc

We welcome contributions to meowdoc! Whether you're fixing a bug, proposing a new feature, or improving the documentation, your help is greatly appreciated.

Here's how you can contribute:

**1. Setting up your development environment:**

*   **Fork the repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

*   **Clone your fork:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/meowdoc.git
    cd meowdoc
    ```
    Replace `<your-github-username>` with your actual GitHub username.

*   **Add the upstream repository:** This allows you to keep your fork synchronized with the main repository.
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/meowdoc/meowdoc.git
    ```

*   **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

*   **Install dependencies:**  *(Replace `requirements.txt` with the correct file if needed)*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

*   **Install pre-commit hooks (optional, but recommended):**
    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install
    ```
    This will automatically run checks on your code before you commit, ensuring code style and quality.

**2. Making changes:**

*   **Create a new branch:**  Create a branch for your changes.  Name it something descriptive, like `fix-typo-in-readme` or `add-new-feature`.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
    ```

*   **Make your changes:**  Edit the code or documentation as needed.

*   **Write tests:**  If you're adding new functionality, please write tests to ensure it works correctly and prevent regressions.

*   **Follow the coding style:**  We try to adhere to the PEP 8 style guide for Python. The pre-commit hooks will help you with this.

*   **Commit your changes:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
    ```

*   **Sync your fork:**  Before submitting a pull request, make sure your fork is up-to-date with the main repository.
    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/main
    ```

**3. Submitting a pull request:**

*   **Push your changes to your fork:**
    ```bash
    git push origin <your-branch-name>
    ```

*   **Create a pull request:**  Go to your fork on GitHub and click the "Compare & pull request" button.

*   **Write a clear and descriptive pull request:**  Explain what problem you're solving, how you're solving it, and any potential side effects. Link to any relevant issues.

*   **Be responsive to feedback:**  We may ask you to make changes to your pull request.  Please be patient and address the feedback.

*   **Pull requests will be reviewed by maintainers:**  Once approved, your pull request will be merged into the main branch.

**Guidelines for specific contributions:**

*   **Bug fixes:**  Include steps to reproduce the bug, and explain how your fix resolves it.

*   **New features:**  Discuss your proposed feature with the maintainers before implementing it.  This will help ensure that the feature aligns with the project's goals.

*   **Documentation:**  Please ensure that your documentation is clear, concise, and accurate.  Pay attention to grammar and spelling.
