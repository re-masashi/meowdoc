# `themes.py` Documentation

This module provides functionalities related to enabling and managing MkDocs themes. It defines a dictionary of available themes and a function to install the necessary packages for a given theme.

## Module Overview

The `themes.py` module simplifies the process of setting up MkDocs themes by:

-   Defining a central repository of supported themes and their corresponding package names.
-   Providing a function to install the Python package associated with a chosen theme using `pip`.

This helps to abstract away the details of package management and ensures that the correct dependencies are installed when switching between different MkDocs themes.

## `THEMES` Dictionary

```python
THEMES = {
    "default": {"package_name": "", "mkdocs_name": ""},
    "dracula": {"package_name": "mkdocs-dracula-theme", "mkdocs_name": "dracula"},
    "material": {"package_name": "mkdocs-material", "mkdocs_name": "material"},
}
```

The `THEMES` dictionary is a core component of this module. It maps theme names (keys) to dictionaries containing information necessary for enabling the theme.  Each inner dictionary contains the following keys:

-   `package_name`: The name of the Python package that needs to be installed to use this theme. An empty string indicates that no additional package needs to be installed (likely meaning the theme is built-in to MkDocs).
-   `mkdocs_name`: The name of the theme as recognized by MkDocs itself. This value is used within the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file.

**Supported Themes:**

-   `default`: Represents the default MkDocs theme.
-   `dracula`: Represents the Dracula theme, leveraging the `mkdocs-dracula-theme` package.
-   `material`: Represents the Material for MkDocs theme, leveraging the `mkdocs-material` package.

## `enable_theme` Function

```python
def enable_theme(theme="dracula"):
    subprocess.run(
        ["pip", "install", THEMES[theme]["package_name"]],
        check=True,
        capture_output=True,
        text=True,
    )
    pass
```

This function installs the Python package associated with a given MkDocs theme.

**Parameters:**

-   `theme` (str, optional): The name of the theme to enable. Defaults to "dracula". The `theme` must be a valid key in the `THEMES` dictionary.

**Functionality:**

1.  It retrieves the `package_name` associated with the specified `theme` from the `THEMES` dictionary.
2.  It uses the `subprocess.run` function to execute the `pip install` command, installing the package.
3.  The `check=True` argument ensures that a `subprocess.CalledProcessError` exception is raised if the `pip install` command fails (e.g., if the package cannot be found).
4.  `capture_output=True` captures the standard output and standard error of the `pip install` command, allowing for logging or debugging. `text=True` ensures that the output is decoded as text.
5. An empty `pass` statement at the end of the function serves as a placeholder (likely intentional).

**Example Usage:**

```python
import themes

themes.enable_theme("material")  # Enables the Material theme
```

This would install the `mkdocs-material` package.

## Interaction with other modules

The `themes.py` module is primarily used by the `mkdocs.py` module. Specifically, the `update_mkdocs_nav` function in `mkdocs.py` utilizes this module to:

1.  Set the `theme` setting in `mkdocs.yml` to the `mkdocs_name` value corresponding to the chosen theme in the `THEMES` dictionary.
2. Call the `enable_theme` function to install the theme's package.

## Notes and Considerations

-   Error Handling: The `enable_theme` function includes basic error handling by checking the return code of the `pip install` command. However, more robust error handling (e.g., catching specific exceptions, logging errors) could be added.
-   Dependencies: This module assumes that `pip` is installed and available in the system's PATH.
-   User Feedback: The `enable_theme` function currently does not provide any direct feedback to the user about the installation process (other than potential error messages). Adding logging or print statements could improve the user experience.
-   Security:  It's important to ensure that the packages installed by `pip install` are from trusted sources to avoid potential security vulnerabilities.
